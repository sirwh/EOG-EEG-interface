EOG-EEG-interface
=================
This is a matlab/simulink project of an EOG/EEG hybrid human-machine interface.

It contains the following three folders:

  1. EOG calibraion: to calibrate the eye movements (blink/wink/frown/gaze).
  2. ERP training: to train the classifier of ERPs.
  3. Realtime: to detect the eye movements and ERPs online (and control some devices).

The EOG and EEG signals are measured by g.tec.
